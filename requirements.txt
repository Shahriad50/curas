--------------Residence Automation System Requiments--------------

#What is required of our system? 

1. Keep track of all the apartment owners and residents in a database: 
	 The system could update the database with new residents as
	 they move in, and remove residents as they move out. The system could also
	 allow residents to update their own contact information, such as phone numbers 
	 and email addresses etc.(which is one of many.)
	 
2. Show any visitor which apartment is available based on their criteria:  
	 The system could allow visitors to search for available apartments based on 
	 criteria such as the number of bedrooms, the square footage, and the monthly 
	 rent. Visitors could also be able to view detailed information about each apartment, 
	 including photographs, floor plans, and a list of amenities. 
	 
3. Access control: the system could send residents notifications when visitors arrive
	 and allow them to grant or deny access remotely, or from a concierge desk.(--etc)

4. Maintenance and repair management: 
	 The system could allow residents to submit maintenance and repair requests. 
	 Once a request is submitted, the system could automatically notify the appropriate
	 maintenance staff, and allow residents to track the status of their request
	 in real-time.
	 
5. Parking management: 
	 The system could allow residents to reserve parking spots in advance. 
	 It could also provide real-time information on the number of available 
	 parking spots to visitors and residents.

6. Community features: 
	 The system could include a calendar of events, a forum for discussion, 
	 and allow residents to create and join groups based on their interests. 
	 Additionally, the system could allow residents to communicate with each
	 other and the building staff, and post announcements and updates on the 
	 bulletin board.

7. Online Order Management: 
	 The system could automatically notify residents 
	 when a package is delivered to the building, and allow them to request for 
	 package to be delivered to a specific location within the building, such as 
	 the front desk, or to their own apartment.
	 
8. Smart scheduling: 
	 The system could automatically schedule cleaning, maintenance, and other services
	 based on the occupancy and usage of the building. Additionally, it could allow 
	 residents and staff to schedule events, or reserve common areas and amenities,
	 such as gym, pool or meeting rooms, and enforce rules and regulations. 
	 
9. Rent collection: 
     The RAS system can be integrated with a payment gateway, allowing residents 
	 to make rent payments online. The system can automatically track rent 
	 payments and send reminders to residents who have not yet paid.
	 
10. Rent history: 
	 The RAS can keep a record of all rent payments, including the date, amount, and method 
	 of payment. This information can be accessed by residents through.

11. Rent reports: 
	 The RAS can generate reports on rent payments, including the total amount collected,
	 the number of payments, and the number of residents who have paid their rent, which 
	 can be useful for building managers and owners to understand and track the financial 
	 aspect of the building.
